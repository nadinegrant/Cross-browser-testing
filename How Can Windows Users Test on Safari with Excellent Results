<h1>How Can Windows Users Test on Safari with Excellent Results</h1>
How many times you worked a lot on a website to make it perfect and realized you are only able to test in Windows-based browsers? If you wanted to test the way your site looks and works in Safari or other browsers that aren’t compatible with Windows, you had to install a virtual machine on your computer and put macOS on that virtual machine to test. This happens after Apple decided not to prolong support for Safari on Windows. Yes, there was a time when Safari worked on Windows as well. However, that ended with the launch of macOS Mountain Lion. But we’re not here to give you the history of why Safari isn’t available for Windows anymore, or talk about the beef between Apple and Microsoft. We’re here to give you a simple way to <a href="https://comparium.app/safari-for-windows.html">test on Safari as a Windows user</a>.
